This Haskell code suffers from a space leak due to the improper handling of thunks in the `calculate` function.  The `expensiveCalculation` function is called multiple times unnecessarily, each time creating a new thunk that's never garbage collected.  This can lead to performance degradation and even crashes with sufficiently complex or resource-intensive computations. 
```haskell
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

data = [Just 1, Nothing, Just 2, Just 3, Nothing]

calculate :: [Maybe Int] -> Maybe Int
calculate [] = Nothing
calculate (x:xs) = case x of
  Just n -> Just $ n + fromMaybe 0 (calculate xs)
  Nothing -> calculate xs

expensiveCalculation :: Int -> Int
expensiveCalculation n = sum [1..n*1000000]

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = calculate data
  print result
```
